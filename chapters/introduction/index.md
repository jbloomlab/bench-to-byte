# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

This guide was created for biologists with moderate computational proficiency who want to optimize their workflow. This guide is _not_ intended to teach you a particular coding language like `Python` or `R`. Instead, you'll learn how to organize projects, navigate the complexities of software environments, and build robust and reproducible pipelines. You'll not only learn the _how_ but also the _why_ behind each practice, ensuring you can apply these skills to streamline your research and foster reproducibility and collaboration.

::: tip A Quick Note
At the moment, this course is geared towards scientists at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center and the [Bloom lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html) in particular. In the future, we might adapt this course to be useful for a general audience.

   > Versioning your code with `git`
5. [Working collaboratively](/chapters/working-collaboratively/)
   > Collaborating correctly with `GitHub`
6. [Managing software environments](/chapters/managing-software-environments/)
   > Using `conda` to isolate software environments
7. [Reproducible workflows and pipelines](/chapters/creating-workflows-and-pipelines/)
