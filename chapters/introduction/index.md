# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

We made this guide for biologists with moderate programming experience who want to optimize their workflow. This guide is _not_ intended to teach you a particular coding language like `Python` or `R`. Instead, you'll learn how to organize projects, navigate the complexities of software environments, and build robust and reproducible pipelines. You'll not only learn the _how_ but also the _why_ behind each practice, ensuring you can apply these skills to streamline your research and foster reproducibility and collaboration.

::: tip A Quick Note
At the moment, this course is geared towards scientists at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center. In the future, we might expand this resource to apply to a more general audience.
