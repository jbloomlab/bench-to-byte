## Naming variables

How should you name variables? Follow the conentions of your language. Be consistent.

## Commenting code

Don't over comment. Say why code is the way it is, not what the code is doing.

## Modularizing code

When do you write a function. When do you break code into more than one script.

## Debugging

How do you write code that's easy to debug. How to use log and print statements. Use errors and warnings to your advantage.

## Testing

This is sort of advanced. It can be really useful for tools or code that changes a lot and you think others will use it.
