## What's a pipeline?

Pipelines group together different computational steps one after the other. People often accomplish this with `bash`. But there's a better way. You can use a 'workflow language.' There are many alternatives, but the key similarity is that they're smart.

## Snakemake

Snakemake is one of the easiest to learn and most common worflow languages in Bioinformatics. It's simple to learn because it's a superset of `Python`.

## Alternatives

Snakemake isn't the only workflow language. There's also `make`, `WDL`, and `Nextflow`. You might run into these as well.

## Helpful Resources

The Snakemake tutorial is the best.
