# {{ $frontmatter.title }}

In [the last section](), I talked about tracking your code with `git`. In principle, this can all happen locally in your repository, but in some cases you want to make a _remote_ copy of a repository and it's history. That's where services like [GitHub](https://github.com/) come in. GitHub is a website that acts a remote...

## Using GitHub as a 'remote'

What's a remote? Why use GitHub (working collaboratively and hosting documentation with GitHub Pages)? How do `git` + GitHub work together? What are the GitHub organizations that we use in our lab (`jbloomlab` for most projects, and `dms-ve`p for projects related to `dms-vep`)? Anything code that I think is likely to be connected to a paper I try to track with Git and connect to `GitHub` as early as possible.

## Collaborative Workflows

How do you work together productively? Protecting the main branch as the final version. Making local branches related to issues or features. When should you make a branch? Merging those features into the main branch using pull requests.

### Pull Requests

What is a pull request and how do you make one? When do you need to do thisâ€“I often don't use this method if this is the only way I'm working on a project.

### Merge Conflicts

What happens if you and someone else edit the same files? Rebase and linear commit histories.

## Issues and Discussions

How to suggest changes to code or make suggestions on big projects. Always make an issue and don't use Slack.
