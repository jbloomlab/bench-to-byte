## What is an 'IDE'?

A quick description of an Integrated Development Environment (IDE). An IDE is more than just a text editor.

## What problem do IDEs solve?

We have tools like `Rstudio` for `R` and `Jupyterlabs` for `Python`, so why do we want to use an IDE? As biologists, we're often working with multiple languages and tools simultaneously. You might need to edit a python script, rearrange a directory structure, draft a `markdown` file, and write a `bash` script all in short succession. An IDE provides one central location where all of these things can be done at the same time.
