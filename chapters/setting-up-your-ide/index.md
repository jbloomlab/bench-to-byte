Those familiar with coding will know the importance of using the appropriate text editor. Hopefully you know better than to write code in Microsoft Word. You've probably encountered tools like `Rstudio` for writing `R` code, or `Jupyter` for writing `Python` code. These tools are a perfectly reasonable way to write code, but they're inherently limited to a handful of languages. This quickly becomes an issue in scientific programming where a single project might invlove `bash`, `Python`, `R`, and `markdown`.

Thankfully, an IDE, or an _Integrated Development Environment_, provides an excellent solution. You can write `markdown` descriptions of your project, edit a `bash` script, organize your directories, read a log file, and run a `Python` script in the terminal all in the same window. We can't stress enough how useful an IDE can be. However, so much functionality in one program can be complicated and intimidating. Below, we'll introduce you to Visual Studio Code (VSCode), one of the most approcable IDEs for general purpose programming.

## Getting started with VSCode

- What is Visual Studio Code?
  It's maintained by Microsoft. It's a free version of Visual Studio â€“ a true IDE.

- How do you install VSCode?
  Here are some simple instructions for how to download VSCode. The actual details are going to depend on your operating system. For a more detailed overview, here's a link to the documentation for VSCode.

## Configuring VSCode

VSCode starts out as little more than a glorified text editor. The real power of VScode comes from it's configurability. You'll want to configure some basic settings. You'll also want to add extensions that are relevant to your coding needs.

- Here are some basic extensions that you'll probably want
  - Intellisense for your language of choice
  - Liniting
  - Autoformatting
  - Grammar and Spellcheck

## VSCode shortcuts

- Opening a terminal window
- Changing your preferences

## Helpful Resources

There are other IDEs. There are some IDEs that are amazing for a particular language. There are more full featured IDEs. However, for you average jack-of-all trades, VSCode is the go to.
