# Bench to Byte: A biologist's guide to crafting quality code

Our goal is to empower biologists with the tools necessary for efficient coding. This course is designed for life scientists with moderate computational proficiency who want to optimize their workflow. Youâ€™ll learn how to organize projects, navigate the complexities of software environments, and build robust and reproducible pipelines. This guide will walk you through the essential steps needed to elevate your coding skills. You'll not only learn the "how," but the "why" behind each practice, ensuring you can apply these skills to streamline your research and foster reproducibility and collaboration.

*Note: A the moment, this course is geared towards scientists at the Fred Hutch Cancer Center and the [Bloom lab](https://research.fredhutch.org/bloom/en.html) in particular.*
